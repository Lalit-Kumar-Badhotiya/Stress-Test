Here’s a basic JavaScript (Node.js) code using the popular k6 tool to stress test a website. k6 is a performance testing tool written in Go, but the scripts are written in JavaScript.

✅ Step 1: Install k6
Make sure you have k6 installed. If not, install it using:
choco install k6   # Windows (using Chocolatey)
brew install k6    # macOS (using Homebrew)


✅ Step 2: Run the test
In terminal:

k6 run test.js

⚠️ Caution: Simulating 10,000 users will consume high system/network resources. Use this wisely, preferably on staging environments.
